# Speculative decoding benchmark: full workload

`spec_bench.py` measures llama-server decode speed with and without a DSpark
drafter (the v1 Ternary-Bonsai-27B drafter and our DSpark v2 drafter), on one
GPU, over chat, code, math, reasoning, long-form, tool-call and agent prompts. It also measures multi-slot concurrency and GPU
power, and it checks that the drafter does not change the output. One clean
run gives the numbers that say whether the drafter is usable in practice.
The tool needs Python 3 and nothing else.

## Run it

Run from the demo directory after `./setup.sh`, with the GPU idle:

```bash
python3 dflash-training/eval/spec_bench_full/spec_bench.py \
    --binary-dir bin/cuda \
    --model models/bonsai2-gguf/27B/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-PQ2_0.gguf \
    --drafter-v1 models/bonsai2-gguf/27B/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-dspark-dflash-Q4_0.gguf \
    --drafter-v2 models/bonsai2-dspark/bonsai2-dspark-full2step600-Q4_K_M.gguf \
    --slots 1,2,4 --repeats 1 \
    --out dflash-training/eval/spec_bench_full/results/gb10
```

`--bin-dir` is the flag name; `--binary-dir` is accepted as an alias.
Relative paths resolve against the demo directory (the nearest ancestor of
the tool with `setup.sh` and `scripts/`, or `BONSAI_DEMO_DIR`). The tool
prints a plan with an ETA per run and the exact llama-server command for
each server before it starts. It refuses to launch a server while
`nvidia-smi` lists other compute processes, because numbers from a shared
GPU are not publishable; `--allow-busy-gpu` overrides that for a smoke test.

The default run with `--slots 1,2,4` launches nine servers in sequence
(three configs, three slot counts) and never runs two at once. The printed
plan gives an ETA of about 78 minutes at the assumed rates (30 tok/s plain,
60 tok/s with a drafter); `--plan-only` prints the plan and the server
commands and exits. The run needs these files:

| File | Default path |
| --- | --- |
| llama-server | `bin/cuda/llama-server` (`--bin-dir`) |
| Target model | `models/bonsai2-gguf/27B/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-PQ2_0.gguf` (`--model`) |
| DSpark v1 drafter | `models/bonsai2-gguf/27B/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-dspark-dflash-Q4_0.gguf` (`--drafter-v1`) |
| DSpark v2 drafter | `models/bonsai2-dspark/bonsai2-dspark-full2step600-Q4_K_M.gguf` (`--drafter-v2`) |

The v1 file is PrismML's Ternary-Bonsai-27B drafter (GGUF header name
`Bonsai-27B-dspark`, `dflash.block_size` 4). Its block size is 4, so the
runtime clamps `--spec-draft-n-max` to 4; the `dspark-v1` config runs at
K=4 for that reason. The v2 drafter has block size 7 and runs at K=5.

Useful flags:

- `--configs baseline,dspark-v2` runs a subset. `--add-config dspark-v2-k7=path.gguf:7`
  adds a drafter config with another draft length; added configs always run.
- `--slots 1` (the default) skips the multi-slot runs.
- `--repeats 3` runs every prompt three times per server.
- `--no-single` skips the single-prompt passes; `--single-repeats`,
  `--single-n-predict` and `--single-prompt` change them.
- `--n-predict 256 --n-predict-long 1000` changes the token budgets. `--n-predict`
  covers the matrix, tool and agent sets.
- `--prompt-ids code-01,tool-01`, `--categories code,tool` or `--limit 3`
  select prompts for a smoke test.
- `--reasoning-effort low` sets `chat_template_kwargs.reasoning_effort` on the
  chat requests. The default keeps the template default, which is `xhigh` on
  Bonsai 2.
- `--no-power` skips the nvidia-smi sampling; `--power-idle-s 20` lengthens the
  idle window; `--gpu-index 1` samples another GPU.
- `--plan-only` prints the plan, the ETA and every server command, then exits.
- `--server-extra "--threads 8"` appends flags to every launched server.
- `--note "text"` records a note in the results and the summary.

## Dry run against running servers

`--server-url NAME=URL` uses a running server for one configuration instead
of starting one. Use it to test the client without a GPU window:

```bash
python3 dflash-training/eval/spec_bench_full/spec_bench.py \
    --server-url baseline=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
    --server-url dspark-v2=http://127.0.0.1:8081 \
    --prompt-ids code-01,tool-01,agent-01 --n-predict 128 --warmup-tokens 0 \
    --note "dry run, not publishable"
```

A running server keeps its own flags and may be shared, so numbers from a
dry run are not publishable. The summary marks such servers as remote. In
this mode the power samples come from the client host, which may not be the
host that runs the server; the summary says so. `dryrun/` holds one such run
against two shared servers on busy GPUs; it shows the output format and
nothing more.

## What it measures

For every config and every slot count the tool starts a server, waits for
`/health`, samples idle power for 10 s, sends one short warm-up request, runs
the prompts, and stops the server by the process id it started.

| Config | Server flags in addition to `-ngl 999 -fa on -c 16384 -np <slots> --jinja` |
| --- | --- |
| `baseline` | none |
| `dspark-v1` | `-md <DSpark v1 drafter> --spec-type draft-dspark --spec-draft-n-max 4 -ngld 999` |
| `dspark-v2` | `-md <DSpark v2 drafter> --spec-type draft-dspark --spec-draft-n-max 5 -ngld 999` |

`--jinja` makes the server apply the model's own chat template, which the
tool and agent prompts need for the tools list. `-c` is the total context;
llama-server divides it over the slots, so a slot has 4096 tokens at
`-np 4`. The concurrency prompts fit in that.

### Single slot: the workload matrix

With one slot every selected prompt runs once per pass.

- Matrix and long prompts go to `POST /completion` with `temperature 0`,
  `seed 42`, `cache_prompt false` and `return_tokens true`. The client wraps
  the prompt in the ChatML template with no system message, so every server
  receives the same bytes. This matches the GB10 workload matrix in
  `community-benchmarks/`.
- Tool and agent prompts go to `POST /v1/chat/completions` with a `tools`
  list, `tool_choice auto`, `max_tokens 512`, `temperature 0`, `seed 42` and
  `cache_prompt false`. The server applies its template. On this build
  (b10687) the chat response carries the same `timings` object as
  `/completion`, with `predicted_per_second` and the draft counters, so the
  speed comes from there. When a build omits `timings`, the row falls back to
  `usage.completion_tokens` over the request wall time (prefill included) and
  records `timings_source: wall`; the summary says when that happened.

From each response the tool records `timings.prompt_n`, `predicted_n`,
`predicted_ms` and `predicted_per_second` (decode only, prefill excluded),
and the draft counters `draft_n` and `draft_n_accepted`. llama-server puts
these counters in the response only when a drafter is loaded; the tool
warns when a drafter configuration returns none, because that means
speculation is not engaged.

The summary reports, per workload and per drafter configuration:

- `no drafter` and the drafter column: arithmetic means of
  `predicted_per_second` over the same prompts.
- `accept`: accepted / drafted tokens, aggregated over the workload.
- `tok/step`: generated tokens per verify step, `predicted_n / (predicted_n -
  draft_n_accepted)` over the workload. Every step yields one target-sampled
  token plus the accepted drafts, so a server without a drafter is at 1.00.
- `speedup`: the ratio of the two means.

The rows are the five matrix categories, `tool`, `agent`, a blended row over
the 40 matrix prompts, and a row for the 6 long prompts. A second table lists
every long prompt on its own. `results.json` also carries a token-weighted
rate (total tokens / total decode time), the mean prompt length and the
tokens per step per row and per request.

### Single prompt

Every single-slot server also runs the quicksort prompt of the PrismML GB10
document ("Implement quicksort in Python with type hints, tests, and a
concise complexity explanation") for 3 passes at 256 tokens, on
`/completion` with the client-side ChatML template, after the prompt set.
The summary lists the rate of every pass, the mean, acceptance, tokens per
step and speedup per config. These rows are not part of the workload matrix,
but they take part in the exactness check, and the baseline passes are
compared with each other.

### Tool calls

The tool prompts ask for one of four functions: `get_weather`,
`search_docs`, `run_sql` and `create_ticket`, defined with JSON schema
parameters in `prompts.json`. Per response the tool records whether the
output is a well-formed tool call: the server's structured `tool_calls`
(name and a JSON object of arguments), or, when the server returned none,
`<tool_call>` blocks parsed from the text in the JSON form or the
`<function=name><parameter=k>v</parameter></function>` form of the Bonsai 2
template. A call is valid when every call is well formed and names a tool
from the list. The summary reports the valid count, how many answers called
the expected tool, the finish reasons and where the call came from
(`structured` or `text-*`). On this build the server returns structured
`tool_calls` with `finish_reason: tool_calls`.

### Agent turns

The agent prompts are subagent-style turns: a shared system prompt of about
1,700 tokens (role, rules, tool list, house style, report format), a task,
one prior tool call and its result of 500 to 750 tokens (fake grep, ls, test,
git log, jest, docker, lint and curl output), then the assistant turn with
`max_tokens 512`. The templated prefix is about 3,000 tokens. This measures
generation after a long prefix; the summary states the mean prefix length.

### Multi-slot

For every slot count above 1 the tool launches the server with `-np N` (and
the drafter when the config has one) and fires a fixed 8-prompt subset (2
code, 2 chat, 2 reasoning, 2 tool) in waves of N concurrent requests. The
summary reports, per config and slot count:

- `per stream`: the mean `predicted_per_second` that each request saw.
- `aggregate`: generated tokens over the wall time of all waves, prefill
  included. The `slots 1` row uses the same prompts from the single-slot run.
- `accept`: aggregated acceptance over the subset.
- `result`: `ok`, the exact error when the server refused or a request
  failed, or a note when a drafter server returned no draft counters.

A server that exits at start with `-np N` and a drafter is a finding, not a
failure of the tool: the run records the last error lines of the server log
and continues with the next run.

### Power

While a server runs, a background thread samples
`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.draw,utilization.gpu,memory.used` at 1 Hz on
the host that runs the tool. Each sample carries a phase: `idle` (model
loaded, no request), `warmup` or `generation`. Per server the summary lists
idle W (mean over the idle window), mean and max W during generation, mean
GPU utilization, generated tokens, `gen tok/s` (tokens over the wall time of
the generation phase, prefill included) and energy per generated token in
mJ/token = mean W / gen tok/s x 1000. `memory.used` is `[N/A]` on a unified
memory GPU such as the GB10 and is then recorded as null.

## Prompt set

`prompts.json` holds 62 original prompts and the tool definitions:

- 40 matrix prompts, 8 each for code, math, reasoning, chat and long-form,
  with a 512 token budget.
- 6 long prompts (code and one math word problem) with a 2000 token budget.
- 8 tool prompts, 2 per function, with a 512 token budget and the expected
  function name.
- 8 agent prompts with the shared `agent_system` prompt, the `agent_tools`
  list (`run_shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `search_code`), one prior
  tool call and its result, with a 512 token budget.

Every matrix and long prompt is under 120 tokens with the Bonsai 2 tokenizer.
Bonsai 2 thinks before it answers, so most of a 512 token budget is reasoning
text; that is what the earlier matrix measured too. The chat template adds a
"reasoning effort xhigh" line to the system prompt of the chat requests
unless `--reasoning-effort` changes it.

## Exactness

At temperature 0 a correct drafter must not change the output. The tool
compares every drafter output with the baseline output for the same prompt
and pass, from the single-slot runs. `/completion` outputs are identical when
their token id sequences are equal. Chat outputs (reasoning, answer and tool
calls) are compared as text, because `/v1/chat/completions` returns no token
ids. For a different output the summary lists the 0-based index of the first
differing token or character; when one output is a prefix of the other, the
index equals the shorter length. For chat prompts the tool also hashes the
templated prompt from `/apply-template`, so a difference caused by a
different server template is marked as such. With `--repeats` above 1 the
tool also reports whether the baseline outputs were identical across passes.

## Output files

The output directory holds:

- `placeholders.json`: a flat map of printed strings for the document fill
  step, for example `code.v2.speedup: "2.06x"`, `tool.v1.accept: "52.1%"`,
  `single.baseline.p1: "61.5"`. Keys: `labels.{baseline,v1,v2}`;
  `single.{baseline,v1,v2}.{p1,p2,p3,mean}` and `single.{v1,v2}.{speedup,accept,tok_step}`;
  `<W>.baseline` and `<W>.{v1,v2}.{tps,accept,speedup,tok_step}` for `W` in
  code, math, reasoning, chat, longform, tool, agent, blended (the 40 matrix
  prompts) and long2000 (the 6 long prompts); `slots.<N>.baseline.{stream,aggregate}`
  and `slots.<N>.{v1,v2}.{stream,aggregate,accept,speedup,aggregate_speedup}`
  (`speedup` is the per-stream ratio, `aggregate_speedup` the wall-clock
  throughput ratio; an `error` key holds the server's refusal); `power.source`,
  `power.idle.w`, `power.{baseline,v1,v2}.{w,mj}`; `exact.{v1,v2}.{identical,total}`.
  A missing value prints as `n/a`. Configs added with `--add-config` use
  their own name as the key.
- `results.json`: the header (host, GPU name and driver from nvidia-smi,
  CUDA, GPU processes at start, llama-server version and build, every flag,
  the plan with the ETA, size and SHA-256 of every local model file, the
  prompt file hash), one record per server run (config, slots, mode, URL,
  exact server command, `/props` build, model, slots and context, drafter
  GGUF metadata such as `dflash.block_size`, load time, power summary), one
  row per request (category, set, config, slots, pass, wave, endpoint,
  prompt tokens, generated tokens, milliseconds, tok/s, drafted, accepted,
  finish reason, tool call fields, output hash and length), the summary
  tables, the long-form table, the single-prompt table, the tool-call
  summary, the multi-slot table, the power records, the placeholders map and
  the exactness report.
- `summary.md`: the workload matrix, the long-form table, the single-prompt
  table, the exactness section, the tool-call table, the multi-slot table,
  the power table, any request errors and the configuration with every
  server command line.
- `outputs.json`: the full output text (and token ids for `/completion`) of
  every request, for an offline diff.
- `server-<config>-np<slots>.log`: llama-server output for every launched
  server.

The tool writes the files after each server run, so a partial run keeps its
data.

## Post-processing scripts

Three scripts next to the tool work from a run's output directory and never
touch `spec_bench.py`:

- `fill_placeholders.py <results_dir>` reads `results.json` (schema 2) and,
  when present, `single.json`, and writes `placeholders.json`: a flat map of
  printed strings for the document. Workload figures come from the request
  rows: `<W>.baseline` (also `<W>.baseline.tps`) and `<W>.{v1,v2}.{tps,accept,speedup,tps_step}`
  for `W` in code, math, reasoning, chat, longform, tool, agent, blended and
  long2000, where `tps_step` is `predicted_n / (predicted_n - draft_n_accepted)`
  over the workload. `single.{baseline,v1,v2}.{p1,p2,p3,mean}` and
  `single.{v1,v2}.{speedup,accept,tps_step}` come from `single.json` (or from
  the tool's own single-prompt rows when `single.json` is absent).
  `slots.<N>.*`, `power.*` and `exact.*` come from the multi-slot, power and
  exactness sections. Config names map to keys as baseline, dspark-v1 -> v1,
  dspark-v2 -> v2; `labels.*` hold the document labels. The script lists every
  expected key the run did not produce; `--strict` makes that an error.
- `fill_doc.py <doc.md> <placeholders.json> [--check] [--out FILE] [--strict]`
  replaces every `{{BENCH:key}}` marker in the document. It reports markers
  without a value and values without a marker, and refuses to write when any
  marker would remain. `--check` writes nothing; `--strict` treats an `n/a`
  value as missing.
- `single_prompt_bench.py --out <results_dir> [--configs ...] [--add-config ...]`
  reuses the server launch and `/completion` client of `spec_bench.py` to run
  the quicksort prompt (256 tokens, temperature 0, seed 42) for 3 passes per
  config on a launched server, one server at a time, and writes `single.json`
  and `single-outputs.json` into the results directory. `--server-url NAME=URL`
  uses a running server instead.

Order for a document: run `spec_bench.py`, run `single_prompt_bench.py` with
the same `--out`, run `fill_placeholders.py <out>`, then
`fill_doc.py doc.md <out>/placeholders.json --check` and, when the check is
clean, the same command without `--check`.

## Tests

```bash
cd dflash-training/eval/spec_bench_full
python3 -m unittest tests.test_spec_bench tests.test_postprocess
```

`tests/test_postprocess.py` checks the three scripts against the dry-run
results (missing keys expected), a synthetic `results.json` that covers every
key, a document with markers (check, refuse, fill in place and to a file), and
the single-prompt runner against the fake `llama-server`.

The tests check the prompt set (including the tool and agent sets), the
tool-call parser, the power math, the tokens-per-step math, the summary
math, the single-prompt summary, the placeholders map, the exactness rules,
the multi-slot table, the markdown shape and, with a fake `llama-server`,
the launch, poll and stop path, the single-prompt passes, the multi-slot
waves, a drafter server that refuses `-np 2`, and the wall-time fallback for
a chat response without `timings`. They need no GPU and no model files.
